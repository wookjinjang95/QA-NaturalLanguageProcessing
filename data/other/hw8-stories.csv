"An oven broke because the broiler of the oven activated.  
The oven scorched a group of treats and created some fire.  
The husband of a narrator who owned a house and owned the oven attempted for the husband of the narrator to retrieve the group of treats and discovered that the oven had created the fire.  
The husband of the narrator unsuccessfully tried to eliminate the fire.  
The husband of the narrator quickly shut the door of the oven in order to prevent the fire spreading.  
The narrator retrieved a fire extinguisher.  
The husband of the narrator opened the door of the oven.  
The fire ascended to the ceiling of the house.  
The oven began to be broken, and the fire extinguisher eliminated the fire.  
The fire didn't damage the group of things of the house.  
The house aired, and the husband of the narrator and the narrator cleaned the house in order for the house to be normal.  
The husband of the narrator and the narrator used some griddle and used a toaster oven.  
The narrator ordered a new second oven.  
The narrator began to be excited because she had ordered the second oven.

","Woohoo!! So excited about my new range I ordered a few days ago. Seriously, I can hardly wait. A couple of weeks ago we had a fire in our old oven/range. The oven malfunctioned... it was supposed to be baking at 350 degrees but somehow broiler came on and got stuck??... my husband went to get a batch of cookies and found them in flames. He tried to put the fire out unsuccessfully and then quickly shut the door to keep the fire from spreading. I ran and got a fire extinguisher. He opened the oven door and the flames shot all the way up to the ceiling!!! Luckily the fire extinguisher worked but our stove was toast. Nothing got damaged besides the range but it took days of airing the house out and cleaning before things were 100% back to normal. Since then we have been using a plug-in burner, griddle, and counter top oven. Not exactly the most convenient but so much better than nothing!! Can't wait to have a real range again."
"There once was a crow.  The crow was sitting on a branch of a tree.  Some cheese was in the beak of the crow.  
A fox observed the crow and tried to discover how to get the cheese.  
The fox came and stood under the tree.  
The fox looked toward the crow and said that he saw a noble bird who was above him.  
The fox said that the beauty of the bird was incomparable.  
The fox said that the hue of the plumage of the bird was exquisite.  
The fox said that -- if the sweetness of the voice of the bird is equal to the fairness of the appearance of the bird -- the bird would be undoubtedly the queen of every bird.  
The crow felt that the fox had flattered her and cawed loudly in order for she to show him that she was able to sing.  
The cheese fell.  
The fox snatched the cheese, said that the crow was able to sing and the fox said that the crow needed wits.

","A Crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. 
Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said, ""What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the Birds."" 
The Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said, ""You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits."""

","Will was playing his favorite song.  The song was about a flower.  Will stopped singing and went outside.  A single star was out in the night sky.  Will got hungry and went inside to get a biscuit.  He also had jam with it.  He didn't want chicken, gravy, or butter on his biscuit.  Will sat and finished his dinner in the kitchen.  Will walked over to the living room.  On his way there, he put a napkin in the trashcan.  When he was in the living room, it started to rain.  It stopped raining and Will walked all the way to the store.  When at the store, Will had a good laugh at a very silly looking dog.  Will heard it start to thunder.  Will looked outside to see if it was raining again, and it was not.  Will was happy he didn't have to get wet walking home.  He went outside smiling.

"A clever fox invited a stork to dine.  
The fox only served some soup in a flat and large dish.  
The fox lapped the soup with relish.  
The stork attempted to drink some savory broth and failed.  
The fox believed that distress was amusing.  
The stork shortly invited the fox to dine.  
The stork presented the fox with a pitcher.  
The stork easily fitted the long bill of the stork into the long and narrow neck of the pitcher.  
The stork enjoied some dinner.  
The fox began to be hungry and began to be helpless because he wasn't able to reach some food that was in the pitcher.

","A Fox invited a Stork to dinner, at which the only fare provided was a large flat dish of soup. The Fox lapped it up with great relish, but the Stork with her long bill tried in vain to partake of the savoury broth.  Her evident distress caused the sly Fox much amusement. But not long after the Stork invited him in turn, and set before him a pitcher with a long and narrow neck, into which she could get her bill with ease. Thus, while she enjoyed her dinner, the Fox sat by hungry and helpless, for it was impossible for him to reach the tempting contents of the vessel."
"There once was a fat bull.  The bull was grazing in a meadow.  
A lion watched the bull and salivated because the lion wanted to eat the bull.  
The lion didn't attack the bull because the lion feared sharp every horn of the bull.  
The lion began to be hungry and decided to attempt to kill the bull.  
The lion planned to trick the bull because the lion wasn't able to fight the bull.  
The lion walked toward the bull and began to feign that the lion was friendly.  
The lion said to the bull that the lion admired the body of the bull, admired the head of the bull, he admired every shoulder of the bull and admired every thigh of the bull.  
The lion advised the bull to remove every horn of the bull because every horn of the bull was ugly.  
The lion succeeded in persuading the bull to remove every horn of the bull.  
The lion ate the bull, and the bull began to be defenseless.

","A Lion watched a fat Bull feeding in a meadow, and his mouth watered when he thought of the royal feast he would make, but he did not dare to attack him, for he was afraid of his sharp horns.
Hunger, however, presently compelled him to do something: and as the use of force did not promise success, he determined to resort to artifice.
Going up to the Bull in friendly fashion, he said to him, ""I cannot help saying how much I admire your magnificent figure.  What a fine head!  What powerful shoulders and thighs!  But, my dear friend, what in the world makes you wear those ugly horns?  You must find them as awkward as they are unsightly.  Believe me, you would do much better without them.""
The Bull was foolish enough to be persuaded by this flattery to have his horns cut off; and, having now lost his only means of defense, fell an easy prey to the Lion."
"A summit meeting named G20 summit started on eventful today.

",Today was a very eventful work day. Today was the start of the G20 summit. It happens every year and it is where 20 of the leaders of the world come together to talk about how to run their governments effectively and what not. Since there are so many leaders coming together their are going to be a lot of people who have different views on how to run the government they follow so they protest. There was a protest that happened along the street where I work and at first it looked peaceful until a bunch of people started rebelling and creating a riot. Police cars were burned and things were thrown at cops. Police were in full riot gear to alleviate the violence. As things got worse tear gas and bean bag bullets were fired at the rioters while they smash windows of stores. And this all happened right in front of my store which was kind of scary but it was kind of interesting since I've never seen a riot before.

","Louisiana was adversely affected by Hurricane Gustav. I've added information to the left hand side of my blog where you can assist the hurricane relief. Here's what happened to me and my family:
We watched the storm moving in all of last weekend on the Weather Channel and local news. I went to Home Depot just in the nick of time to purchase a portable generator. I filled up my three SUVs and I filled up five five-gallon containers of gasoline. We purchased supplies to last us a few days. Since I live about 60 miles from the coast, I wasn't expecting too much damage.
The storm rolled in on Monday, September 1, in the morning. Power went out about 11:00am. Winds started kicking up. We were told our area would get winds of about 50mph. I live in an area where there are lots of large pine and oak trees.
About 12:30pm, I was standing on my back patio when I watched a large tree split in two and fall in my neighbor's yard. I started to get nervous at that point because I have numerous trees near my home and I was concerned that if those fell, it would cause serious damage to my home and perhaps to my family. My wife, our five children, and our dog, stayed in an area of the home where we felt safest.
Then, I heard a large crash. I looked out my front window and saw that a tree from my across-the-street neighbor's house had fallen on top of another neighbor's RV. Trees were dropping all around us. Another tree fell on my riding lawn mower and my golf cart. Fortunately, no trees fell on my house. Many of my neighbors were not so fortunate.
President Bush came to Baton Rouge yesterday to assess the damage. I have three good friends on Governor Jindal's cabinet and I know that they are doing a super job bringing things back to order. It's been three days since the storm and I still do not have electricity - but that is expected given all the downed power lines. Unfortunately, my brand new generator does not work - I brought it in for repair. Thankfully, my parents' house had electricity restored the day after the storm so I was able to bring my family to their house until electricity at my house gets restored. There are downed trees and power lines all over the city.

","Kelly woke up one morning and went outside to her back yard. She was in a hurry because it was Mother's Day and she had to collect flowers before her mom woke up to give to her as a present. She was going to give her mom the biggest, most beautiful bunch of flowers her mother had ever seen. She knew where the best flowers were in her yard. She got a lot of different sized flowers. The red ones were big, the orange ones were small, and the green ones were in the middle. After Kelly collected all of the flowers, she went inside and tied them together with string. After that, she had to hide the flowers in a secret spot. She hoped her baby sister Morgan, who was still in diapers, wouldn't find the flowers and eat them. Kelly was worried, so she hid them in a new spot that was up higher. Finally, her mother woke up at 8:30 AM, and Kelly was excited! Kelly gave her mother the flowers. Her mother's favorite was the red one.

"There once was a group of students and a narrator.  The narrator was a teacher, owned some white slip and owned a desk.  The narrator was teaching the group of students language.  
The narrator checked the group of students for presence and stood at the front of a classroom.  
The slip fell because the not-functional elastic of the slip was dysfunctional.  
The group of students saw that the slip had fallen because the elastic of the slip was dysfunctional.  
The narrator noticed that the ankle of the narrator was observed.  
The narrator nervously looked toward the ankle of the narrator and observed that the slip had fallen because the elastic of the slip was dysfunctional.  
The narrator glanced around the group of students.  
The narrator carefully stepped over the slip.  
The narrator feigned bewilderment.  
The narrator lifted the slip and inserted it into a bottom drawer of the desk.  
The narrator resumed teaching, and the group of students didn't react.  
The narrator later feared for the group of students to tell a parent of the group of students that the group of students had seen that the slip had fallen because the elastic of the slip was dysfunctional.

","Just thought I would share with you one of my most embarassing moments as a teacher to date. Ten years ago I was teaching a mixed class of 5th graders ESL. I had taken the register and was standing at the front of the class doing some revision... However, all eyes were not on my face but at my ankles. Nervously I looked down to see that my underslip had somehow made its way to the floor. Elastic gone What to do? So I looked at my underwear round my ankles, looked at the class, looked back at the garment, carefully stepped out of it, said, ""Oh dear look, what on earth can that be?"", lifted the offending white (not red and black thank the Lord) slip and casually popped it in the bottom drawer of my desk. I continued, ""Ok class, page 33."" No one, strangely, batted an eyelid. Later that day I wondered how they had described the day to their parents over dinner. ""So Ahmed, what did you do in school today?"" ""We looked at the teacher's underwear."""
"An eagle swooped toward a serpent and seized it in order for he to devour it.  
The eagle fought with the serpent, and the serpent coiled around him.  
A countryman who owned a drinking vessel tried to help the eagle to escape.  
The eagle escaped, and the countryman freed the eagle from the serpent.  
The serpent spat some poison in the drinking vessel.  
The countryman decided to sip from the drinking vessel.  
The eagle spilled the drinking vessel.

","An Eagle swooped down upon a Serpent and seized it in his talons with the intention of carrying it off and devouring it. But the Serpent was too quick for him and had its coils round him in a moment; and then there ensued a life-and-death struggle between the two. A countryman, who was a witness of the encounter, came to the assistance of the Eagle, and succeeded in freeing him from the Serpent and enabling him to escape. In revenge the Serpent spat some of his poison into the man's drinking-horn. Heated with his exertions, the man was about to slake his thirst with a draught from the horn, when the Eagle knocked it out of his hand, and spilled its contents upon the ground."
 The narrator placed the bowl on the deck in order for Benjamin to drink the bowl's water. The bowl was popular. The birds drank the bowl's water. The birds bathed themselves in the bowl. The birds organized themselves on the deck's railing in order for the birds to wait. The squirrels drank the bowl's water. The squirrel approached the bowl. The squirrel was startled. The squirrel leaped because the squirrel was startled. The squirrel fell over the deck's railing because the squirrel leaped because the squirrel was startled. The squirrel held the deck's railing with the squirrel's paw. The squirrel's paw slipped off the deck's railing. The squirrel fell.,"1	The	the	_	DT	_	2	det	_	_

","This is one of those times I wish I had a digital camera. We keep a large stainless steel bowl of water outside on the back deck for Benjamin to drink out of when he's playing outside. His bowl has become a very popular site. Throughout the day, many birds drink out of it and bathe in it. The birds literally line up on the railing and wait their turn. Squirrels also come to drink out of it. The craziest squirrel just came by- he was literally jumping in fright at what I believe was his own reflection in the bowl. He was startled so much at one point that he leap in the air and fell off the deck. But not quite, I saw his one little paw hanging on! After a moment or two his paw slipped and he tumbled down a few feet. But oh, if you could have seen the look on his startled face and how he jumped back each time he caught his reflection in the bowl!"

","Alyssa got to the beach after a long trip. She's from Charlotte. She traveled from Atlanta. She's now in Miami. She went to Miami to visit some friends. But she wanted some time to herself at the beach, so she went there first. After going swimming and laying out, she went to her friend Ellen's house. Ellen greeted Alyssa and they both had some lemonade to drink. Alyssa called her friends Kristin and Rachel to meet at Ellen's house. The girls traded stories and caught up on their lives. It was a happy time for everyone. The girls went to a restaurant for dinner. The restaurant had a special on catfish. Alyssa enjoyed the restaurant's special. Ellen ordered a salad. Kristin had soup. Rachel had a steak. After eating, the ladies went back to Ellen's house to have fun. They had lots of fun. They stayed the night because they were tired. Alyssa was happy to spend time with her friends again.

"There once was a lion.  The lion was sleeping in a lair.  
The lion awaked because a mouse ran into the face of the lion.  
The lion lost temper and seized the mouse with the paw of the lion.  
The lion began attacking the mouse.  
The mouse began to be extremely frightened and piteously entreated the lion to spare it.  
The mouse said that -- if the lion were to free the mouse -- the mouse would repay kindness.  
The lion began to be amused.  
The lion laughed aloud because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The lion good-naturedly freed the mouse.  
Opportunity arrived.  
A trapper spread some net in order to catch a big game.  
The lion entangled himself in the net.  
The mouse heard that the lion was roaring with anger.  
The mouse recognized the voice of the lion.  
The mouse ran to the lion.  
The mouse immediately began gnawing the rope of the net with the tooth of the mouse.  
The mouse soon succeeded in freeing the lion.  
The mouse said that the lion had aloud laughed because he thought that the mouse is extremely not able to help him.  
The mouse said that the lion was seeing that the mouse is able to help him.

","A Lion asleep in his lair was waked up by a Mouse running over his face. Losing his temper he seized it with his paw and was about to kill it. The Mouse, terrified, piteously entreated him to spare its life. ""Please let me go,"" it cried, ""and one day I will repay you for your kindness."" The idea of so insignificant a creature ever being able to do anything for him amused the Lion so much that he laughed aloud, and good-humouredly let it go. But the Mouse's chance came, after all. One day the Lion got entangled in a net which had been spread for game by some hunters, and the Mouse heard and recognised his roars of anger and ran to the spot. Without more ado it set to work to gnaw the ropes with its teeth, and succeeded before long in setting the Lion free. ""There!"" said the Mouse, ""you laughed at me when I promised I would repay you: but now you see, even a Mouse can help a Lion."""

","It was Saturday afternoon and Andrew was bored. He had been watching TV all day. He told his dad, ""There's nothing to do!""  Andrew's dad said, ""I think the newspaper is here. Maybe we can find an idea in the newspaper."" Andrew looked outside the window and saw the newspaper by the door. On the front was a picture of an elephant.  He picked up the newspaper and brought it to his dad.  Andrew and his dad read the story.  The circus was in town!  Andrew had never been to the circus. He asked his dad, ""Can we go?"" ""Yes, we can,' Andrew's dad said, 'but first you need to feed your goldfish.""  Andrew fed his goldfish some goldfish food. He promised to bring it some peanuts from the circus for later.  Andrew and his dad went to the circus.  The people and animals at the circus did lots of tricks. The elephant even went down a slide!  Andrew and his dad ate lots of peanuts.  There weren't any peanuts left to bring home to the goldfish.  Andrew and his dad had a lot of fun at the circus.

"A young man long ago crashed the motorbike of the young man on the front yard of a narrator and broke the neck of the young man.  
The narrator stayed with the young man and didn't aid him because the young man had broken the neck of the young man.  
The young man died on the spot of the yard of the narrator.  
The narrator later went back to the spot of the yard of the narrator and decided to talk to the young man because it wanted the young man to know the narrator regretting that it had not aided him.  
The narrator saw some bright flash in a group of trees that was above the narrator.  
The narrator thought for the brother of the narrator to use the flashlight of the brother of the narrator.  
The narrator entered the house of the narrator and heard that the asleep family of the narrator was asleep.  
The narrator began to wonder that the flash was an orb","1	A	a	_	DT	_	3	det	_	_

","A few years ago, a young man died out on my front lawn when he crashed his motorbike. 
I was with him in his last moments but there was
nothing I could do because he was badly injured with a broken neck. 
Later, when I was visiting the place where he died, I decided to talk to him as if he were still there because I wanted him to know how bad I felt that I couldnt help him. 
And I know this sounds crazy, but I saw this ball of light in the trees above me. 
At first, my logical mind thought that it was my brother playing around with his new flashlight (not at all like it, but the closest thing I could imagine)
And when I went inside the house, everyone was snoring! Lol could this have been what they call an orb 
PS. Not the first weird experience ive had.

"There once was a fox and a fowl.  The fox was nightly prowling a yard.  He was stealing the fowl.  
An agriculturist began to be annoyed by the fox.  
The agriculturist set a trap and caught the fox.  
The agriculturist tied some fiber onto the tail of the fox and in order to retaliate.  
The agriculturist kindled the fiber and freed the fox.  
The agriculturist began to be unlucky because the fox ran into a field.  
Some corn began to be ripe in the field and began to be ready to a harvest.

","A Farmer was greatly annoyed by a Fox, which came prowling about his yard at night and carried off his fowls. So he set a trap for him and caught him; and in order to be revenged upon him, he tied a bunch of tow to his tail and set fire to it and let him go. As ill-luck would have it, however, the Fox made straight for the fields where the corn was standing ripe and ready for cutting. It quickly caught fire and was all burnt up, and the Farmer lost all his harvest."

","Maxine was a happy frog that lived in a beautiful pond by the river. She loved to play in the water and take a bath every day. But her friends, Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like to take baths. So one day when she was swimming alone, she met a new friend named Thomas. Thomas loved to take lots of baths, so he became friends with Maxine. But Martin, Edgar, and Cindy didn't like Thomas. So one day when Maxine and Thomas were swimming, Cindy did something mean. She threw rocks at Maxine and Thomas. Maxine's dad saw what happened and he was very mad. He went over and yelled at Cindy for what she did. After that Cindy didn't throw any rocks, and Maxine and Thomas could swim together and take lots of baths. They were very happy since they could play in the water as much as they wanted without other frogs being mean to them.
